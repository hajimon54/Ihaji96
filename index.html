      Hey there 👋, my name is Idris Haji and I am a graduate from university of east London and graduated with a degree in computing for business 👨🏽‍🎓. 
      Although the course is called computing for business it did not focus primarily on programming and web development which is the field I wanted to get into, 
      hence why I am applying for this course as I know I will be able to think logically when it comes to creating websites and web applications 👨🏽‍💻.

      <h2>Why Coding ?</h2>
  
      <p1>
        After giving myself a break from work, my cousin (Mohamed Osman) and a close friend of mine (Ayub Mohamud) highly recommended me to jump into the world of coding and see how it is for me personally. 
        At first, I was just testing the waters with a few exercises here and there and overtime I gradually got hooked onto it without even noticing. During the process of learning about coding I found out that there were many different concepts that I could learn about which made got me interested even more. 
        When it comes to coding, you must think creatively as sometimes the answer isn’t obvious and clear cut. So trying to look for the answer can sometimes be very long and stressful but since I was persistent and dedicated to look for the answer I knew I could somehow find the solution to the problem I was 
        faced with and the buzz I got after solving a problem was incredible.
